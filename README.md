# ExcelToSQLServer
ASP.NET app to play around with programmatically taking data from an Excel spreadsheet, 
and then placing that data into a local SQL Server database. A simple update button, when clicked, 
will update the database based on data currently in the spreadsheet file.

The spreadsheet file is located at ExcelToSQLServer/SpreadSheets. Any new records add to the spreadsheet
should be added to the database next time the update button is clicked.
